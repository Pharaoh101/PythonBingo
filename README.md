# PythonBingo
Python script to automate the running of Bingo within BT Cardiff
This is only a temporary measure to remove the manula work that was previously being done.
Future development is going to be a web app/phone app, on a different repo (coming soon)

Feel free to ask me any questions about my reasoning for certain decisions etc

Requirements:

  1. pip install openpyxl
  2. pip install pypiwin32
